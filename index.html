          Kyle Hanquist is an Assistant Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering (AME) at the University of Arizona, where he is the Director of the Computational Hypersonics and Nonequilibrium Laboratory (CHANL). His research group is active in the development and application of physical models and computational methods for simulation of complex phenomena such as nonequilibrium and reactive flows experienced during hypersonic flight.
          
          Previously to joining the department, Prof. Hanquist was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Lecturer in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. He has research experiences at NASA Ames Research Center in the area of aerothermodynamics and heat shield design and has teaching interests in the area of fluid mechanics and computational methods. He earned his Ph.D. (2017) and M.S.E. (2015) in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan and a B.S.E. (2012) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Nebraska.
          
          Dr. Hanquist is a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the AIAA Thermophysics Technical Committee, and the American Physical Society (APS).
